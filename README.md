#Introduction to the command line#

You have read in files, wrangled data and plotted some graphs in Rstudio but now we're going to teach you how you can leave the Rstudio environment and learn a bit about running scripts in your operating system. 

To do this, we're going to introduce you to the command line and show you how to access, navigate and modify files and folders without using a mouse. 

The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks - making it an important programming tool.

##What is the command line?##

The command line is an interface or interpreter for typing commands directly to a computer's operating system. In short it's this fantastic black box that allows us to intstruct the computer to perform tasks without using the mouse.

The command line allows us to speak to the computer by typing in text commands. It's fast powerful and swift.

If you run OSx or a Linux based operating system then you are in luck, the command line is going to be your best friend. 
The bad news is that if you run Microsoft Windows your life is going to be a lot tougher. Windows is hostile to developers and not a comfortable environment to code in. 

##How do we access the command line?##

We interact with the command line from a terminal in Linux or OSX or if you are running a windows machine we're going to use a virtual terminal that we'll run from the browser. First create an account on Python Anywhere. 

In OSX or Linux we're going to need to install iterm, which is just a nice terminal.

##Getting started##

Ok first thing's first. Open up your terminal and take a look. There should be some text at the top of the terminal saying something like this:
